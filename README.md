# site-poll
# About:-
Renders two sites for comparison.
# Story:-
My friend designed a company's website and his design was way cooler than the company's. Another friend wanted to redesign a project he had done in the past and I knew this time, he would design better than last time. I thought it would be cool to have a platform where users can see both sites and vote their favorite.
# Process:-
I am using Flask for this because at this time, that is all I know. The MVP will be a webpage with the site url and developer, a 'more info' button that leads to a page with the site screenshot and some information about the developer or the site, and a vote button with the vote count.

In the future, I will use a screenshot api instead of manually inserting a picture. Secondly, I will implement a way to add new sites to the polling booth without writing code.
